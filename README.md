# Dog Breed Identifier - Android App with Machine Learning Recognition
Dog Breed Identifier is an Android application that enables users to identify over 70 different dog breeds from pictures of dogs using a machine learning model called resnet-18. The model is hosted on Google Cloud, and the API that connects the Android app to the model is built using FastAPI, a modern, fast, and high-performance web framework for building APIs with Python 3.7+.

The machine learning component of the project is written in Python using the PyTorch framework, a powerful and flexible deep learning platform. The Android app is written in Java and allows users to take a picture of a dog or choose an existing picture from their device's gallery. Once the user selects a picture, the app sends it to the FastAPI API, which returns the predicted dog breed.

This project demonstrates the integration of cutting-edge technologies, including machine learning, cloud computing, and modern web frameworks, to solve complex real-world problems.
